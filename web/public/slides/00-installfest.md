### Command Line Tools

Xcode is a large suite of software development tools and libraries from Apple. The Xcode Command Line Tools are part of XCode. Installation of many common Unix-based tools requires the [GCC compiler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Compiler_Collection). The Xcode Command Line Tools include a GCC compiler.

1. Run from the command line: `xcode-select --install`
2. Choose `install tools` from the prompt and `agree` to the terms
3. If you recieve a message saying "Can't install the software because it is not currently available from the Software Update server"... it's probably because the command line tools are already installed...
4. Agree to the license by typing `sudo xcodebuild -license`
5. Press enter, then `q`
6. Then on the next prompt, type `agree`

### Homebrew Package Manager

Homebrew is a package manager for ~~OSX~~ **Linux**.

#### What are packages?

Packages are bundles of source code distributed by developers of software, which can be compiled and installed on your machine.

#### Install

1. The package manager allows us to install and update software (like Ruby, Git, MongoDB, etc) from the command line:
2. Open [http://brew.sh/](http://brew.sh/), scroll down to Install Homebrew and copy+paste the command into the terminal.
3. Ensure that Homebrew is raring to brew and fix any issues: `brew doctor`
4. Update Homebrew: `brew update`

(**Note**: the absolute paths will not be used after the next step, but might not be needed if they already have `/usr/local/bin` in their \$PATH)

---

## üíª macOS Installfest

### Zsh

#### What is a shell?

We will go into a bit more detail about the shell later on in the course but a shell is a very basic user interface for accessing an operating system's services.

##### bash vs zsh

Macs before OSX Catalina came shipped with a shell called 'bash' by default. Bash stands for **'Bourne-again shell'**, referring to its objective as a free replacement for the Bourne shell which was developed by [Steven Bourne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_R._Bourne).

---

## üíª macOS Installfest

### Oh-My-Zsh üåà

Oh My Zsh is an open source, community-driven framework for managing your zsh configuration. Here is the link to the [Github](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh).

The `PATH` environment variable is a colon-delimited list of directories that your shell searches through when you enter a command.

1. Type

   ```sh
   sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
   ```

2. Restart the terminal (close and open)

---

## üíª macOS Installfest

### Oh-My-Zsh üåà

3. Type this in your terminal

   ```sh
   code ~/.zshrc
   ```

4. Add following to `.zshrc` file to make VSCode the default text editor:

   ```sh
   export EDITOR='code -w -n'
   export PAGER='less -f'
   ```

5. Restart the terminal (close and open) the prompt should be a tilde (**~**), and in colours.

---

## üíª macOS Installfest

### Install nvm

1. Open a terminal window and type:

   ```sh
   curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.35.3/install.sh | bash
   ```

2. Once is installed type this:

   ```sh
   export NVM_DIR="$([ -z "${XDG_CONFIG_HOME-}" ] && printf %s "${HOME}/.nvm" || printf %s "${XDG_CONFIG_HOME}/nvm")"
   [ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && \. "\$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh"

   ```

3. Type `source ~/.nvmrc` to include the new folders to the current `$PATH`

4. Now that nvm is installed, we want to list the available versions, type:

   ```sh
   nvm ls-remote
   ```

   - And you will be shown a list of all the available versions of node

---

## üíª macOS Installfest

### Install nvm

5. Install the latest version of node and the current **Long term support** (_LTS_)
   ```sh
   nvm install node
   nvm install --lts
   ```
6. Check that Node is installed, type

   ```sh
   node --version
   ```

   - You should see the last version number that you've installed

7. To use `nvm use` automatically in a directory with a `.nvmrc` file add [this script](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#zsh) to `.zshrc`

---

## üíª macOS Installfest

### Yarn

1. Install Yarn

   ```sh
   brew install yarn
   ```

---

## üíª macOS Installfest

### ESLint

#### Create `.eslintrc.json` file

- Let define some rules for `eslint`

  ```sh
  code ~/.eslintrc.json
  ```

- Copy and paste this [text](https://gist.github.com/pataruco/353b75f87ad809dc96b64174b2201f60#file-eslintrc-json) in the file `.eslintrc.json`
- Save file <kbd>command</kbd> + <kbd>S</kbd>.

#### Install `eslint` packages

Install the following **eslint** packages

```sh
yarn global add eslint@latest eslint-config-prettier@latest
```

---

## üíª macOS Installfest

### Prettier

#### Create `.prettierrc.json` file

- Let define some rules for `prettier`

  ```sh
  code ~/.prettierrc.json
  ```

- Copy and paste this [text](https://gist.github.com/pataruco/353b75f87ad809dc96b64174b2201f60#file-prettierrc-json) in the file `.prettierrc.json`
- Save file <kbd>command </kbd> + <kbd>S</kbd>.

#### Install `prettier` packages

Install the following **prettier** packages

```sh
yarn global add prettier
```

---

## üíª macOS Installfest

### Install Git

Git is the version control system that we will use throughout the course. It is one of the most powerful tools you will use as a developer.

1. This ensures we can upgrade Git more easily:
   `brew install git`
2. Restart the terminal
3. Ensure you're not using "Apple Git" from the path `/usr/bin/git` by checking `which git` and `git --version`
4. Configure your name and email address for commits (be sure to use the email address you have registered with Github):

```sh
 git config --global user.name "Your Name"
 git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
```

---

## üíª macOS Installfest

### Global `.gitignore`

There are a few files that we don't want Git to track. We can specifically ignore them by adding the files to a global `.gitignore` file.

#### `.DS_Store` files

are used by macOS to store folder specific metadata information. They are different for every mac, it means that they often cause conflicts in version controlled folders.

Since we never want to track `.DS_Store` files, we can make a global `.gitignore` file, and tell git to use it for all repositories:

```sh
echo .DS_Store >> ~/.gitignore_global
git config --global core.excludesfile ~/.gitignore_global
```

---

## üíª macOS Installfest

### Global `.gitignore`

#### `public/uploads/`, `node_modules` & `bower_components`

In the same way, we want to never track the contents of our uploads folder in Rails (which usually contain images or media that we have uploaded during testing) or our node_modules or bower_components.

```sh
echo "/public/uploads/\nnode_modules/\nbower_components/" >> ~/.gitignore_global
```

---

## üíª macOS Installfest

### Configure SSH keys on Github

GitHub is a web-based Git repository hosting service. It allows us to keep a remote version of our version-controlled projects. When we push and pull from Git, we don't want to always have to login to verify who we are. Therefore, what we can do is generate and use something called an SSH key. SSH keys are a way to identify trusted computers, without involving passwords.

1. First, we need to check for existing SSH keys on your computer. Open up your Terminal and type:
   ```sh
   ls -al ~/.ssh
   ```
   Check the directory listing to see if you have files named either **id_rsa.pub** or **id_dsa.pub**. If you have either of those files you can skip to the step 'add your SSH key to Github'.
2. Generate a new SSH key
   ```sh
    ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "your_email@example.com"
   ```

---

## üíª macOS Installfest

### Configure SSH keys on Github

3. You'll be prompted for a file to save the key, and a passphrase. Press enter for both steps (default name, and no passphrase)
4. Then add your new key to the ssh-agent:
   ```sh
    ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
   ```
5. Add your SSH key to GitHub by logging into Github, visiting **account settings** and clicking **SSH keys**. Click **Add SSH key**
6. Copy your key to the clipboard with the terminal command:
   ```sh
    pbcopy < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
   ```

---

## üíª macOS Installfest

### Configure SSH keys on Github

7. On Github, create a descriptive title for your key, an paste into the `key` field - _do not add or remove and characters or whitespace to the key_
8. Click `Add key` and check everything works in the terminal by typing:
   ```sh
    ssh -T git@github.com
   ```

---

## üíª macOS Installfest

### Speed up your cursor

During the course, we will be doing a lot of navigating using our keyboards. By default, the speed of the curson on a Mac is a little too slow. Let's increase the speed of the cursor by going to:

```
System Preferences > Keyboard
```

Move both up to maximum.

## Tell the difference...

Please, tell us the difference between:

### Frontend vs Backend

## Frontend vs. Backend

The development process can be broken into two areas:

<div class="row">
   <div>
      <h3>Front-End</h3>
      <ul>
         <li> How things look to the user</li>
         <li> Involves: images, content, structure</li>
         <li> HTML, CSS, and <strong>JavaScript</strong></li>
      </ul>
   </div>
   <div>
      <h3>Back-End</h3>
      <ul>
         <li>How things work</li>
         <li>Involves: ‚Äúbusiness logic‚Äù and ‚Äúdata‚Äù</li>
         <li>Ruby, PHP, C++, Java, <strong>JavaScript</strong> etc.</li>
      </ul>
   </div>
</div>

---

## Tell the difference...

Please, tell us the difference between:

### Website vs Webpage vs Web server

      </li>
      <li>
        Application interprets the request, reads required information from the
        database
      </li>
      <li>Combines the retrieved data with HTML templates</li>
      <li>Sends back a response containing the generated HTML</li>
      <li>Browser read response and re render</li>
    </ol>
  </div>
</div>

---

## Pseudo code

- A great way to break down a problem into small chunks is to use pseudo code.
- Pseudo code is usually typed in comments so it has no effect on the program being written.
- It is typically written in a mixture of natural language and high-level programming constructs.
- It can make your code very understandable and even simplify debugging.

---

## Comments in JavasScript

To comment out a line hit <kbd>cmd</kbd> + <kbd>/</kbd>

```js
// Comment on a single line can be created by two forward slashes

// Comments are greyed out by the editor

/* 
I am a line

Multi line comments are created by using a different syntax 

I am a line
  
*/
```

---

## Pseudo code lab

### Task:

Imagine we have 3 different coloured buttons (red üî¥, blue üîµ and yellow üü°). If a user taps a button, the light changes to that colour. If the selected colour is tapped again, the light turns off.

Write the pseudo code for a programme that controls a light that can changed based on user input.
